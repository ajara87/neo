# Neo VM Fuzzer: Future Work Plan

This document outlines the planned future enhancements for the Neo VM Fuzzer, with a focus on improving DOS detection capabilities, coverage-guided fuzzing, and overall fuzzer effectiveness.

## 1. Enhanced DOS Detection

### 1.1 Advanced Loop Detection
- **Description**: Implement sophisticated pattern recognition to detect potential infinite loops.
- **Implementation**:
  - Enhance `DOSDetector` to track instruction pointer frequencies and patterns

- **Expected Outcome**: More accurate detection of scripts with potential infinite loops, reducing false negatives.

### 1.2 Dynamic Threshold Adjustment
- **Description**: Implement self-tuning thresholds based on corpus statistics.
- **Implementation**:
  - Track execution metrics across the entire corpus
  - Calculate statistical distributions for instruction count, stack depth, etc.
  - Automatically adjust thresholds based on outlier detection
- **Expected Outcome**: More precise DOS detection with fewer false positives and negatives.

### 1.3 Memory Usage Analysis
- **Description**: Add detection for scripts that consume excessive memory.
- **Implementation**:
  - Instrument the VM to track memory allocations and usage
  - Set thresholds for acceptable memory consumption
  - Flag scripts that exceed memory thresholds
- **Expected Outcome**: Detection of memory-based DOS vectors that current metrics might miss.

## 2. Advanced Fuzzing Techniques

  - Use program synthesis techniques to generate minimal exploits
  - Verify exploits in controlled environments
- **Expected Outcome**: Faster verification and remediation of security issues.

### 4.3 Smart Contract Security Patterns
- **Description**: Detect common smart contract security anti-patterns.
- **Implementation**:
  - Define patterns for common smart contract vulnerabilities
  - Implement static and dynamic analysis to detect these patterns
  - Provide remediation guidance for detected issues
- **Expected Outcome**: Improved security of the Neo smart contract ecosystem.

## 5. Performance Optimization

### 5.1 Parallel Fuzzing
- **Description**: Implement distributed fuzzing capabilities.
- **Implementation**:
  - Develop a coordinator-worker architecture for distributed fuzzing
  - Implement efficient corpus synchronization
  - Optimize for different hardware configurations

## Success Metrics

The success of these enhancements will be measured by:

1. **Coverage Improvement**: Increase in code coverage percentage
2. **Issue Discovery Rate**: Number of unique issues discovered per CPU-hour
3. **False Positive Reduction**: Decrease in false positive rate for DOS detection
4. **Performance Metrics**: Execution speed and resource utilization improvements
5. **Integration Metrics**: Time to integrate and deploy fuzzing in CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

This future work plan provides a roadmap for enhancing the Neo VM Fuzzer over the next 15 months. By implementing these improvements, we aim to significantly increase the security, reliability, and performance of the Neo VM, ensuring it remains robust against potential attacks and vulnerabilities.

The plan follows our documentation-first approach, with each enhancement being thoroughly documented before implementation begins. Regular documentation refactoring sessions will be scheduled to keep this plan up-to-date as work progresses.
