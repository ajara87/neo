# Guided Mutation Engine

## Overview
The Guided Mutation Engine is a key component of the enhanced Neo.IO Fuzzer that selects and applies mutation strategies based on coverage feedback. Unlike traditional random mutation approaches, the guided mutation engine uses information about code coverage and previous fuzzing results to make intelligent decisions about which mutation strategies are most likely to discover new code paths or uncover bugs.

## Features

### Coverage-Guided Mutation
- Analyzes coverage data to identify areas of code that have been less thoroughly tested
- Prioritizes mutation strategies that have historically led to new code coverage
- Dynamically adjusts mutation probabilities based on their effectiveness

### Adaptive Mutation Strategy
- Maintains statistics on the effectiveness of each mutation operator
- Increases the probability of mutation operators that have discovered new code paths
- Decreases the probability of mutation operators that have not been productive

### Targeted Mutation
- Identifies "interesting" bytes in the input that influence control flow
- Applies more aggressive mutations to these critical bytes
- Preserves structure in parts of the input that are likely to be format headers or checksums

### Mutation Scheduling
- Implements a schedule for different mutation strategies
- Balances between exploration (trying diverse strategies) and exploitation (focusing on effective strategies)
- Periodically resets statistics to avoid getting stuck in local optima

## Usage Example

```csharp
// Create a guided mutation engine with a set of mutators
var mutators = new List<IMutator>
{
    new BitFlipMutator(),
    new ByteFlipMutator(),
    new ArithmeticMutator(),
    new InterestingValueMutator(),
    new NeoSerializationMutator()
};

var guidedEngine = new GuidedMutationEngine(mutators, random);

// Configure the engine with coverage information
guidedEngine.SetCoverageTracker(coverageTracker);

// Mutate an input using coverage guidance
byte[] mutatedData = guidedEngine.Mutate(originalData);
```

## Integration with Other Components

The Guided Mutation Engine works closely with:

1. **EnhancedCoverageTracker**: Provides detailed coverage information to guide mutation decisions
2. **CorpusManager**: Supplies interesting inputs that have previously discovered new code paths
3. **FuzzerEngine**: Orchestrates the overall fuzzing process and provides feedback on mutation effectiveness

## Implementation Details

The engine maintains the following statistics for each mutation operator:

- Total number of mutations performed
- Number of mutations that led to new coverage
- Number of mutations that led to crashes
- Average execution time for inputs produced by this mutator

These statistics are used to calculate a "utility score" for each mutator, which influences its selection probability.

## Performance Considerations

The Guided Mutation Engine includes optimizations to ensure that the overhead of guidance does not significantly impact fuzzing throughput:

- Caches coverage information to avoid redundant calculations
- Uses lightweight heuristics for quick decision-making
- Periodically updates statistics rather than after every mutation
- Implements a fast random number generator for mutation selection
