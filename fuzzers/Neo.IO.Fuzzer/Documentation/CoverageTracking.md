# Neo.IO.Fuzzer - Coverage Tracking

This document outlines the coverage tracking strategy used by the Neo.IO.Fuzzer to ensure comprehensive testing of the Neo.IO namespace.

## 1. Coverage Metrics

The Neo.IO.Fuzzer tracks several types of coverage:

### 1.1 Method Coverage

Tracks which methods in the Neo.IO namespace are executed during fuzzing:

- **Entry Point Coverage**: Tracks if a method is called at all
- **Exit Point Coverage**: Tracks if a method completes execution
- **Exception Path Coverage**: Tracks if exception handling code is executed

### 1.2 Branch Coverage

Tracks which branches of code are executed during fuzzing:

- **Conditional Branch Coverage**: Tracks if-else statements, switch cases, etc.
- **Loop Coverage**: Tracks entry, iteration, and exit of loops
- **Exception Handler Coverage**: Tracks try-catch-finally blocks

### 1.3 Data Flow Coverage

Tracks how data flows through the code:

- **Variable Definition Coverage**: Tracks where variables are defined
- **Variable Usage Coverage**: Tracks where variables are used
- **Parameter Coverage**: Tracks different parameter values

### 1.4 Boundary Coverage

Tracks testing of boundary conditions:

- **Value Boundary Coverage**: Tracks testing of minimum/maximum values
- **Size Boundary Coverage**: Tracks testing of empty/full/oversized collections
- **Format Boundary Coverage**: Tracks testing of edge cases in data formats

## 2. Implementation Approach

### 2.1 Instrumentation

The Neo.IO.Fuzzer uses runtime instrumentation to track coverage:

- **Method Interception**: Intercepts method calls to track execution
- **Branch Instrumentation**: Adds tracking code to branches
- **Exception Monitoring**: Monitors exception handling

### 2.2 Coverage Database

The fuzzer maintains a database of coverage information:

- **Coverage Points**: Unique identifiers for code locations
- **Execution Counts**: Number of times each point is executed
- **Input Mapping**: Maps inputs to the coverage they achieve

### 2.3 Coverage Visualization

The fuzzer provides visualization of coverage data:

- **Coverage Maps**: Visual representation of covered/uncovered code
- **Coverage Trends**: Visualization of coverage over time
- **Hotspot Analysis**: Identification of frequently/rarely executed code

## 3. Coverage-Guided Fuzzing

### 3.1 Input Selection

The fuzzer uses coverage data to guide input selection:

- **Novelty Selection**: Prioritize inputs that cover new code
- **Rarity Selection**: Prioritize inputs that cover rarely-executed code
- **Difficulty Selection**: Prioritize inputs that cover hard-to-reach code

### 3.2 Mutation Guidance

Coverage data guides mutation strategies:

- **Targeted Mutation**: Mutate parts of inputs that affect specific coverage points
- **Path-Sensitive Mutation**: Mutate to explore specific execution paths
- **Boundary-Focused Mutation**: Mutate to test boundary conditions

### 3.3 Corpus Management

The fuzzer maintains a corpus of interesting inputs:

- **Corpus Minimization**: Remove redundant inputs that don't add coverage
- **Corpus Prioritization**: Prioritize inputs that are likely to yield new coverage
- **Corpus Evolution**: Evolve the corpus over time to improve coverage

## 4. Integration with Neo.IO

### 4.1 Target-Specific Coverage

The fuzzer defines coverage points specific to Neo.IO components:

- **MemoryReader Coverage**: Coverage of all MemoryReader methods and error paths
- **ISerializable Coverage**: Coverage of serialization/deserialization methods
- **ISerializableSpan Coverage**: Coverage of span-based serialization/deserialization
- **Error Handling Coverage**: Coverage of all error handling code

### 4.2 Neo.IO-Specific Metrics

The fuzzer tracks Neo.IO-specific coverage metrics:

- **Type Coverage**: Coverage of different data types
- **Format Coverage**: Coverage of different serialization formats
- **Error Coverage**: Coverage of different error conditions

## 5. Reporting and Analysis

### 5.1 Coverage Reports

The fuzzer generates detailed coverage reports:

- **Summary Reports**: Overall coverage statistics
- **Detailed Reports**: Line-by-line coverage information
- **Differential Reports**: Changes in coverage between runs

### 5.2 Coverage Analysis

The fuzzer provides tools for analyzing coverage:

- **Coverage Gaps**: Identification of uncovered code
- **Coverage Barriers**: Identification of hard-to-cover code
- **Coverage Efficiency**: Analysis of coverage per input

### 5.3 Integration with CI/CD

The fuzzer integrates coverage tracking with CI/CD pipelines:

- **Coverage Thresholds**: Define minimum coverage requirements
- **Coverage Trending**: Track coverage changes over time
- **Coverage Alerts**: Alert on coverage regressions

## 6. Implementation Details

### 6.1 CoverageTracker Class

The `CoverageTracker` class is responsible for tracking coverage:

```csharp
public class CoverageTracker
{
    // Track method execution
    public void TrackMethodEntry(string methodName);
    public void TrackMethodExit(string methodName);
    
    // Track branch execution
    public void TrackBranch(string branchId, bool taken);
    
    // Track exception handling
    public void TrackException(string methodName, Exception exception);
    
    // Get coverage statistics
    public CoverageStatistics GetStatistics();
    
    // Save/load coverage data
    public void SaveCoverageData(string filePath);
    public void LoadCoverageData(string filePath);
}
```

### 6.2 Coverage Point Identification

Coverage points are identified using a consistent naming scheme:

- **Method Coverage**: `Method:Namespace.Class.Method`
- **Branch Coverage**: `Branch:Namespace.Class.Method:LineNumber:BranchType`
- **Exception Coverage**: `Exception:Namespace.Class.Method:ExceptionType`

### 6.3 Coverage Data Storage

Coverage data is stored in a structured format:

```json
{
  "coveragePoints": {
    "Method:Neo.IO.MemoryReader.ReadByte": {
      "hitCount": 1250,
      "inputs": ["input1.bin", "input2.bin", ...]
    },
    "Branch:Neo.IO.MemoryReader.ReadVarInt:123:IfElse": {
      "hitCount": 750,
      "inputs": ["input3.bin", "input4.bin", ...]
    }
  },
  "statistics": {
    "methodCoverage": 0.85,
    "branchCoverage": 0.72,
    "exceptionCoverage": 0.65
  }
}
```
