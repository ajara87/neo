## Overview

The LedgerDebugger plugin provides functionality to capture and replay blockchain blocks without requiring a full ledger sync. It records the minimal state needed during block execution (the "read set"), allowing blocks to be reproduced later for debugging or analysis.

## Features

- üìù **State Capture**: Records the exact storage state read during block execution
- üîÑ **Block Replay**: Re-execute blocks with captured state without full ledger sync
- üìä **Content-Addressable Storage**: Optimizes storage by deduplicating identical values
- üîç **Transaction Debugging**: Isolate and debug specific transactions within a block
- üß© **Minimal State Storage**: Only records state actually used during execution

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Neo Node](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-node) v3.5.0 or later
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 6.0 or later

### Setup

1. Build the plugin or download a release:
   ```bash
   cd neo-plugins
   dotnet build /p:Configuration=Release
   ```

2. Copy the plugin files to your Neo Node's `Plugins` directory:
   ```bash
   cp src/LedgerDebugger/bin/Release/net6.0/ /path/to/neo-node/Plugins/
   ```

3. Add the plugin to your node configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "PluginConfiguration": {
       "Plugins": [
         {
           "Plugin": "LedgerDebugger",
           "Name": "LedgerDebugger",
           "Config": "config.json"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

## Configuration

The plugin is configured through the `LedgerDebugger.json` file:

```json
{
  "PluginConfiguration": {
    "Path": "ReadSets_{0}",
    "StoreProvider": "LevelDBStore",
    "MaxReadSetsToKeep": 10000
  }
}
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `Path` | Storage path pattern. `{0}` is replaced with network identifier | `ReadSets_{0}` |
| `StoreProvider` | Storage provider type (`LevelDBStore`, `RocksDBStore`) | `LevelDBStore` |
| `MaxReadSetsToKeep` | Maximum number of read sets to keep before cleanup | `10000` |

## Usage

### Console Commands

The plugin adds the following console commands to the Neo CLI:

#### Execute Block

```
execute block <block_index> [tx_hash]
```

Re-executes a previously recorded block with its captured state.

- `block_index`: Index of the block to execute (required)
- `tx_hash`: Optional transaction hash to focus on during execution

**Example:**
```
neo> execute block 12345
```

**Example with transaction focus:**
```
neo> execute block 12345 0xd5a99a8a3d1845cd579e13f643054dc08c7af1e5a288657b2b17c9b6455a21b5
```

## Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Capturing Phase**:
   - During normal blockchain operation, the plugin intercepts all storage reads
   - It records the values read from storage during block execution
   - This read set represents the minimal state needed to re-execute the block

2. **Storage Optimization**:
   - Using content-addressable storage, large values (>32 bytes) are stored by their hash
   - Small values (‚â§32 bytes) are stored directly
   - This enables automatic deduplication of identical data across blocks

3. **Replaying Phase**:
   - When a block needs to be replayed, its read set is loaded
   - A memory store is populated with only the required state
   - The block is executed against this minimal state snapshot

### Storage Efficiency

The content-addressable storage approach provides significant benefits:

- **Deduplication**: Identical values are stored only once, regardless of how many times they appear
- **Size Optimization**: Small values bypass the hashing overhead
- **Minimal Footprint**: Only stores state that's actually read during execution
- **Scalability**: Storage requirements grow proportionally to unique state values, not block count

## Best Practices

- Regularly prune old read sets if storage space is constrained
- For debug scenarios, focus on specific transactions to reduce noise
- When debugging contracts, capture blocks that interact with the contract
- Use alongside other debugging tools for comprehensive analysis

## Limitations

- Only captures state read during regular execution, not during verification
- Does not record network state or peer communications
- Requires the original block to be available in the chain
